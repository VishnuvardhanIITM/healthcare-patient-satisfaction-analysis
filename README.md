## 🔍 Key Insights
- Q1 & Q2 show **critical dissatisfaction**.

## 🎯 Business Implications
- Poor experience early in the year may cause:
  - Increased patient churn
  - Decreased trust
  - Negative health outcomes
- Management must ensure **consistent** service delivery

## 💡 Recommendations
To reliably maintain scores **above 4.5**, the hospital should:

✔ Improve staffing & patient communication  
✔ Expand digital check-ins to reduce congestion  

These data-driven decisions will boost experience, loyalty, and revenue.
